# Assignment-Portfolio
This repository contains a variety of assignments from the different classes I enrolled in at Eastern Michigan University. It exists for the purpose of functioning as a portfolio for recruiters to look through. 

To any students that have found this, everything you see here is horribly incorrect and barely functions. 

To any recruiters that are looking at this from an application, please ignore that statement.

To the recruiters that may be looking through this, please note that not every course or skill mentioned in my application may not be present in this repository due to the structure of the course.
