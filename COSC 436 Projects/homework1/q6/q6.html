		<h3>ASUS ROG Zephyrus S GX701</h3>

			<p>A pretty good laptop for top of the line four years ago, and what I use at home. This thing is incredibly light, being too thin to have a stadnard ethernet port, which makes traveling with it very easy. Despite that, the GX701 still manages to pack a punch with its NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 GPU, Intel Core i7-9750H CPU, and 16 gigabytes of DDR4 RAM. On top of all of that, this laptop manages to come with a 17.3 inch 1080p screen with a 144 hertz refresh rate. Definitely worth its hefty asking price even with the "outdated" specs.</p>

			<p>A standard ThinkPad work laptop that comes with everything one would expect from one such as a fingerprint reader and the little red nub in the middle of the keyboard. Aside from that, this specific ThinkPad comes with a 13.3 inch 1080p display, 24 gigabytes of RAM, a 512 gigabyte SSD, and a 4.20 gigahertz Intel Core i7-8650U CPU. However this one is refurbished, so it may not be in peak condition.</p>

		<h3>Apple MacBook Pro</h3>

			<p>The newest MacBook Pro model, a solid choice for those that aren't too fond of windows. Featuring an Apple M2 Pro chip with a 10-core CPU and a 16-core GPU, this one can definitely handle anything. Not to mention its 16 gigabytes of unified memory, 512 gigabytes of SSD storage, and a battery life of eighteen hours, this is certainly worth the money.</p>

			<p>A great budget choice. Featuring an AMD Ryzen 3 7320U quad-core processor and AMD Radeon graphics as well as being incredibly thin, this can make for a great work or school laptop. It comes with 8 gigabytes of LPDDR5 RAM and a 128 gigabyte NVMe SSD, meaning it shouldn't slow down on you. The screen is a solid 15.6 inch full HD display which is suitable for most work.</p>
